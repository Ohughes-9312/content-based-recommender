# Content-Based Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a content-based recommendation system that, given a short text description of a user’s preferences, suggests similar items (e.g., movies) from a small dataset.

## Example Use Case
The user inputs:
"I love thrilling action movies set in space, with a comedic twist."
The system processes this description (query) and compares it to a dataset of items (e.g., movies with their plot summaries or keywords), returning the top 3–5 “closest” matches to the user.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Provide the source or link to the dataset you used]
- **Description**: The dataset contains a list of movies with their plot summaries.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Recommended: Use a virtual environment

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/content-based-recommender.git
   cd content-based-recommender
